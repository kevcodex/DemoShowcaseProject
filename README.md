# DemoShowcaseProject
An app for demo-ing some features I've used. This app was made without any external frameworks or third party libraries besides the swift format command line tool which just helps keep all my code the same format (e.g. uniform line indent, no whitespaces, etc.). This app uses networking to pull in data from a JSON file which is parsed and displayed on a collection view. It has a custom transition to show the details. The app uses auto layout so it can be viewed vertically or horizontally and will adjust cell size appropriately.

Feel free to look at or use the code. :)
